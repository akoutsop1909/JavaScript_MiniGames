# JavaScript MiniGames
This repository contains a collection of simple JavaScript applications/games with an HTML template. The website is accessible for testing from the link in the "about" section.

More specifically, the HTML files in the ```pages``` folder run the following applications:
* ```penalty.html``` simulates a penalty shootout against the computer. 
* ```rock-paper-scissors.html``` plays the game 'rock-paper-scissors' against the computer.
* ```the-king.html``` plays the 'shell game' using the king card.
* ```traffic-lights-easy.html``` tests the player's reflexes with traffic lights.
* ```traffic-lights-hard.html``` is a more difficult version of ```traffic-lights-easy.js```.
* ```virtual.html``` offers user interaction with an avatar.

The ```js``` folder contains the corresponding JavaScript files, while the ```assets``` folder contains all necessary images.

Each HTML file includes instructions (in Greek) on how to play each game.
